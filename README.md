# Songify
A GUI for playing MP3 that allows users to download songs from YouTube. It stores the songs downloaded from youtube in different directories along with the thumbnail it was uploaded with and some basic information about the song in a config.txt folder; to search and add a song simply type in [title of song], [author] and it will find the correct song if it exists on youtube. 
WARNING: Do not use this feature to pirate songs, only use this feature on songs that you explicitly own or are free to public use.
Additionally, I hope to add functionality to the skip and back button including a queueing list and adding more functionality to the search portion.
